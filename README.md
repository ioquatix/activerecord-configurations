# ActiveRecord::Configurations

This gem replaces the default ActiveRecord configurations system which typically involves a YAML file.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/ioquatix/activerecord-configurations/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ioquatix/activerecord-configurations/actions?workflow=Development)

## Motivation

The standard YAML file technique of specifying database configurations is cumbersome at best, and really only works well for a single database connection: there is no isolation between different sets of connections, and it's not possible to specify multiple `DATABASE_URL` values.

We needed something to streamline and minimize the amount of configuration in this sensitive area of deployment. Making a mistake in a production system is a big problem. This is achieved by testing and convention over configuration.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'activerecord-configurations'
```

## Usage

Add something like this to `db/environment.rb`

``` ruby
require 'active_record/configurations'

class ActiveRecord::Base
	extend ActiveRecord::Configurations
	
	configure(:production) do
		prefix 'library'
		adapter 'postgres'
	end

	configure(:development, parent: :production)
end

# pp ActiveRecord::Base.configurations
```

This will setup the `development` and `production` configurations, which can be overridden by specifying the `LIBRARY_DSN` environment variable.

### Multiple Databases

You can easily have more than one database connection.

``` ruby
class UsersModel < ActiveRecord::Base
	self.abstract_class = true
	
	extend ActiveRecord::Configurations
	
	configure(:production) do
		prefix 'users'
		adapter 'mysql2'
	end

	configure(:development, parent: :production)
end

# pp UsersModel.configurations

class User < UsersModel
	# ...
end
```

As this has a different prefix, the connection can be overridden by specifying `USERS_DSN`.
